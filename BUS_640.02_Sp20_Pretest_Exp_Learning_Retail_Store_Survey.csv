We are conducting research in accounting and request your participation.  The purpose of this research study is to support a better understanding of experiential learning techniques.  If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a paper and/or an online survey asking how you feel about your experiences of the term research project.  The study is expected to take about 7-10 minutes to complete.  I believe there are no known risks associated with this research study.  

 

As a student of a business-related field, I hope that this study will help us enhance our understanding of experiential learning in the business field. Except for my hope that your participation in the study may make you feel good helping to advance our understanding of the field of business, I don’t foresee any other benefit for you.  Your participation is completely voluntary.  You are not bound in any way to participate in this study and will not be penalized in any way if you choose not to participate.  If you decide to participate in this study, but have second thoughts about it once the study has started, you may withdraw at any time without any penalty.  I may want to analyze the project and may use the data obtained during the class to do so.  Further analyzing the project may include analyzing grades, understanding instructions, the quality of the responses, timeliness of deliverables, etc.

 

As with any online related activity the risk of a breach of confidentiality is always possible.  To the best of our ability your answers in this study will remain confidential.  I will minimize any risks by storing information in a password protected secure server.
